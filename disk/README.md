# Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This website showcases my projects, skills, and experience as a front-end developer, designed with a modern look and responsive layout using **Tailwind CSS**.

- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes from desktop to mobile.
- **Dark Mode Compatibility**: A dark mode option with Tailwind CSS utilities that switches colors based on the userâ€™s system preferences.
- **Project Showcase**: Displays my key projects, each with a preview image, description, and links to live versions and source code.
- **Fixed Social Icons**: Social media icons are fixed to the right middle of the screen on larger screens and shift to the bottom on smaller screens.
- **Progress Bars**: Animated progress bars created with JavaScript to represent different skill levels.
